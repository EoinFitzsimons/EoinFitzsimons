## 🎯 Current Journey

I'm currently taking a practical break from coding while working as an **IT Support Intern**, gaining valuable real-world experience in:
- 🛠️ Technical troubleshooting and problem-solving
- 👥 Customer service and communication
- 🔧 Hardware and software support
- 📋 IT infrastructure understanding

This hands-on experience is preparing me for my **fourth year of Computing at NCI** where I'll be diving back into development with renewed perspective and practical IT knowledge.

## 🎓 Education & Preparation

**National College of Ireland (NCI)** - Computing Degree
- 📚 Preparing for fourth year (2025-2026)
- 🧠 Building on foundations in programming, algorithms, and software engineering
- 🎯 Planning to specialize in areas that combine my IT support experience with development skills

## 🔄 Getting Back Into Code

After focusing on IT support, I'm gradually returning to coding and planning to:
- 🔄 Refresh my programming skills
- 🚀 Work on projects that bridge IT support and development
- 📈 Build a portfolio that showcases both technical and practical skills
- 🤝 Connect with the developer community again

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Refreshing & Expanding)

*Currently refreshing these skills while gaining new perspectives from IT support work*

## 🏆 What Makes Me Different

**Real-world IT Experience**: My internship in IT support gives me a unique perspective on how technology actually works in business environments, not just in development theory.

## 🎯 2025 Goals

- [ ] Successfully complete fourth year at NCI
- [ ] Build projects that solve real IT problems I've encountered
- [ ] Contribute to open-source projects
- [ ] Transition from IT support to software development role
- [ ] Share knowledge gained from both coding and support perspectives

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, especially those who appreciate the value of real-world IT experience!
